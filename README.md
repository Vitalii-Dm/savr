## 🚀 Overview

**SAVR** is a student-focused, AI-powered financial intelligence platform that transforms raw spending data into actionable insights, gamified savings challenges, and tiered rewards. The React SPA delivers a cinematic, tactile journey from transaction upload to personalized suggestions, while the Python analytics engine processes transactions, detects anomalies, recurring subscriptions, and spending patterns. Together, SAVR helps students save smarter, spend consciously, and earn rewards — all with privacy-first, on-device analytics.

## 💡 Core Features

### 💰 Smart Savings Hero
- 3D Savings Pot using **React Three Fiber + Drei + React-Spring** visually tracks balance vs. goal.  
- Animated liquid, coin-drop effects, and glass refraction respond in real time to deposits and tier progress.  
- Ambient UI elements reflect current reward tier (Bronze → Platinum) and points-to-next-level dynamically.  

### 🧠 Spending Analysis Lab
- Python-powered backend (`financial_logic/analysis.py`) ingests transactions, normalizes timestamps and categories, winsorizes outliers, and tracks spend/income flows.  
- Detects patterns: DOW/time-of-day peaks, merchant concentration, drip-spend leaks, ride-hail usage, late-night spending.  
- Highlights anomalies: weekly spikes, single-day outliers, duplicate charges, and ghost subscriptions.  
- Generates rule-based suggestions and micro-challenges (e.g., Grocery Trim, Subscription Audit) tied to real spending behaviour.  

### 🎯 Gamified Challenges & Insights
- React SPA displays challenges linked to actionable levers: skip coffees, cook meals at home, limit ride-hail trips.  
- Real-time progress tracking via **Framer Motion**, showing points earned and impact on Savings Pot.  
- Insights visualized with **Recharts**, showing category trends, month-over-month deltas, and spending vs. budget.  

### 🏆 Tiered Reward System
- Bronze → Platinum tiers with animated metallic gradients, glowing progress bars, and reward modals.  
- Redeem points for vouchers, experiences, and brand deals; all visually immersive with glassmorphic overlays.  
- Backend logic ensures rewards reflect real financial actions and evidence-based savings.  

### 🧮 Python Analytics Toolkit
- `financial_logic/analysis.py` orchestrates preprocessing, trend analysis, pattern mining, recurring detection, anomaly detection, budget variance, and suggestion generation.  
- Modular design enables SPA consumption of a single summary dict with: trends, anomalies, recurring items, suggestions, challenges, and projected savings.  
- Optional mock mode for demoing without live transactions or API access.
